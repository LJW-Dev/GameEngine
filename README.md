# GameEngine

A game engine i've been making for the past few months.

My main goal with this project is to learn more about C / C++ and how game engines work in detail.

Currently working on: 
- Implementing a custom scripting language for manipulating objects ingame (similar to LUA).

Completed:
- Development variables + console
- Asset loading / finding
- Input system
- Basic physics
- Basic world builder
