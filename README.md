# GameEngine

A game engine i've been making for the past few months.

My main goal with this project is to learn more about C / C++ and how game engines work in detail.

Currently working on: 
- Improve scripting VM to include variables and starting threads from a script.

Completed:
- Basic scripting VM with threads and builtin calls (similar to LUA).
- C# Script compiler (assembly -> opcodes)
- Development variables + console
- Asset loading / finding
- Input system
- Basic physics
- Basic world builder
